I Now yeah, let's get this thing going. Create a new directory, hop on to it and start a new Node project by running npm init -y.

Then install Express by running npm i express and install nodemon as a dev dependency by running npm i -D nodemon (Nodemon is a tool we'll use to get our server running and test it). Lastly, also run npm i cors, which we'll use to be able to test our server locally.# dogs-api
